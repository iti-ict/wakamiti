## Test Execution

To use the Wakamiti JMeter DSL plugin, you currently need to:

1. Create a `.feature` file inside the `test/resources/features` folder and write the scenarios you want to execute.
2. For JUnit execution: Run tests by right-clicking on the `JMeterTest` class located in `test/java/es.iti.wakamiti.plugins.jmeter.test` and selecting `Run`.
3. For Maven execution: Run `mvn clean install` from the console to start the tests.


## Configuration

To configure the outputs and different options of the plugin, you currently need to modify the JMeterConfigContributor.java file located in `src/main/java/es.iti.wakamiti.plugin.jmeter`. There you can adjust the properties as needed by modifying the Configuration DEFAULTS:

```
private static final Configuration DEFAULTS = Configuration.factory().fromPairs(
   BASE_URL, "http://localhost:8080",
   RESULTSTREE_ENABLED, "true",
   INFLUXDB_ENABLED, "false",
   CSV_ENABLED, "false",
   HTML_ENABLED, "false",
   INFLUXDB_URL, "http://localhost:8086/write?db=jmeter",
   CSV_PATH, "./test-results.csv",
   HTML_PATH, "./test-results.html"
);
```
In this case, the only output would be the JMeter Results Tree.

###  `jmeter.baseURL`
Sets the base URL for JMeter tests, which will define the starting point for all HTTP calls that are made.

Default value:
```
 `http://localhost:8080`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  baseURL: https://example.org/api/v2
```

<br /><br />

## Plugin outputs
JMeter can be configured to send test results to different destinations like InfluxDB, CSV files, and HTML reports.

###  `jmeter.output.influxdb.enabled`
Determines whether the output to InfluxDB is enabled. This allows you to maintain a record of all execution statistics through Grafana and view the metrics of interest graphically.
It is important to know that an existing InfluxDB and Grafana server are used, so if you wish to test locally, you should execute a 'docker compose up' within this directory.
Once the containers have started, you can open grafana at http://localhost:3000.


Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    influxdb:
      enabled: true
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.influxdb.url`
Defines the InfluxDB endpoint URL to which JMeter will send the results.

Default value:
```
 `"http://localhost:8086/write?db=jmeter"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    influxdb:
      url: http://tuServidorInfluxDB.com/write?db=nombreDeTuBaseDeDatos
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.csv.enabled`
Enables the generation of test results into a CSV file. The file can be viewed through Excel by navigating to Data -> Get Data -> From File -> From Text/CSV and selecting the generated file.

Default value:
```
 `true`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    csv:
      enabled: false
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.csv.path`
Specifies the path where the CSV file with test results will be saved.

Default value:
```
 `"./test-results-csv"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    csv:
      path: ./resultadosDePruebas/pruebas-csv
```

<br /><br />


### `jmeter.output.html.enabled`
Enables the creation of an HTML report with test results.

Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    html:
      enabled: true
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.html.path`
Specifies the path where the HTML report with test results will be saved.

Default value:
```
 `"./test-results-html"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    html:
      path: ./resultadosDePruebas/pruebas-html
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.resultstree.enabled`
Enables the JMeter Results Tree, which allows you to review all HTTP requests and responses in detail.

Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    resultstree:
      enabled: true
```

### Execute Spike Test
```
I execute a spike test with {numberOfSpikes:int} spikes of {usersPerSpike:int} users, dropping to {usersOffPeak:int} users over {duration:int} minutes
```
Runs a spike test to simulate irregular loads on the system, alternating between a high and low number of users.

#### Parameters:

| `numberOfSpikes`    |   `int`       | Number of load spikes                                    |
| `usersPerSpike`     |   `int`       | Number of users at each spike                            |
| `usersOffPeak`      |   `int`       | Number of users off the spikes                           |
| `duration`          |   `int`       | Duration to maintain the load before a spike             |

#### Example:
```gherkin
  When I execute a spike test with 3 spikes of 1000 users, dropping to 200 users over 5 minutes
```

<br /><br />

### Execute Operational Limit Test
```
I execute an operational limit test starting with {users:int} users, increasing by {incrementUsers:int} up to {maxUsers:int} users with ramp-up periods of {duration:int} minutes
```
Runs a test to find the operational limit of the system, progressively increasing the number of users.

#### Parameters:
|  Name               | Wakamiti type | Description                                              |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `users`             |   `int`       | Initial number of users                                  |
| `incrementUsers`    |   `int`       | User increment                                           |
| `maxUsers`          |   `int`       | Maximum number of users                                  |
| `duration`          |   `int`       | Ramp-up time before increasing users                     |

#### Example:
```gherkin
  When I execute an operational limit test starting with 100 users, increasing by 100 up to 5000 users with ramp-up periods of 2 minutes
```

<br /><br />

### Check Response Time Percentile
```
check that the {percentile:int} percentile of response time is less than {testDuration:int} seconds
```
Verifies that the specified response time percentile is less than the given duration.

#### Parameters:
| Name          | Wakamiti type | Description                                   |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `percentile`  |   `int`       | Response time percentile to check             |
| `testDuration`|   `int`       | Expected maximum duration                     |

#### Example:
```gherkin
 Then check that the 99 percentile of response time is less than 2 seconds
```

<br /><br />

### Check Average Response Time
```
check that the average response time is less than {testDuration:int} seconds
```
Verifies that the average response time is less than the given duration.

#### Parameters:

#### Example:
```gherkin
  Then check that the average response time is less than 2 seconds
```

<br /><br />

### Check for Request Errors
```
check that the number of requests that returned an error is less than {errors:int}
```
Verifica que el nÃºmero de peticiones que han devuelto un error es menor que el nÃºmero especificado.

#### Parameters:
| Name     | Wakamiti type | Description               |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
