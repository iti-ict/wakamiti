## Test Execution

To use the Wakamiti JMeter DSL plugin, you currently need to:

1. Create a `.feature` file inside the `test/resources/features` folder and write the scenarios you want to execute.
2. For JUnit execution: Run tests by right-clicking on the `JMeterTest` class located in `test/java/es.iti.wakamiti.plugins.jmeter.test` and selecting `Run`.
3. For Maven execution: Run `mvn clean install` from the console to start the tests.


## Configuration

To configure the outputs and different options of the plugin, you currently need to modify the JMeterConfigContributor.java file located in `src/main/java/es.iti.wakamiti.plugin.jmeter`. There you can adjust the properties as needed by modifying the Configuration DEFAULTS:

```
private static final Configuration DEFAULTS = Configuration.factory().fromPairs(
   BASE_URL, "http://localhost:8080",
   RESULTSTREE_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE.toString(),
   INFLUXDB_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE.toString(),
   CSV_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE.toString(),
   HTML_ENABLED, Boolean.TRUE.toString(),
   INFLUXDB_URL, "http://localhost:8086/write?db=jmeter",
   CSV_PATH, "./test-results.csv",
   HTML_PATH, "./test-results.html"
);
```
In this case, the only output would be the JMeter Results Tree.

###  `jmeter.baseURL`
Sets the base URL for JMeter tests, which will define the starting point for all HTTP calls that are made.

Default value:
```
 `http://localhost:8080`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  baseURL: https://example.org/api/v2
```

<br /><br />

## Plugin outputs
JMeter can be configured to send test results to different destinations like InfluxDB, CSV files, and HTML reports.

###  `jmeter.output.influxdb.enabled`
Determines whether the output to InfluxDB is enabled. This allows you to maintain a record of all execution statistics through Grafana and view the metrics of interest graphically.
It is important to know that an existing InfluxDB and Grafana server are used, so if you wish to test locally, you should execute a 'docker compose up' within this directory.
Once the containers have started, you can open grafana at http://localhost:3000.


Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    influxdb:
      enabled: true
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.influxdb.url`
Defines the InfluxDB endpoint URL to which JMeter will send the results.

Default value:
```
 `"http://localhost:8086/write?db=jmeter"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    influxdb:
      url: http://tuServidorInfluxDB.com/write?db=nombreDeTuBaseDeDatos
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.csv.enabled`
Enables the generation of test results into a CSV file. The file can be viewed through Excel by navigating to Data -> Get Data -> From File -> From Text/CSV and selecting the generated file.

Default value:
```
 `true`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    csv:
      enabled: false
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.csv.path`
Specifies the path where the CSV file with test results will be saved.

Default value:
```
 `"./test-results-csv"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    csv:
      path: ./resultadosDePruebas/pruebas-csv
```

<br /><br />


### `jmeter.output.html.enabled`
Enables the creation of an HTML report with test results.

Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    html:
      enabled: true
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.html.path`
Specifies the path where the HTML report with test results will be saved.

Default value:
```
 `"./test-results-html"`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    html:
      path: ./resultadosDePruebas/pruebas-html
```

<br /><br />

### `jmeter.output.resultstree.enabled`
Enables the JMeter Results Tree, which allows you to review all HTTP requests and responses in detail.

Default value:
```
 `false`
```

Example:
```yaml
jmeter:
  output:
    resultstree:
      enabled: true
```

### Execute Peak Test
```
a peak test with {peaks:int} peaks of {peakUsers:int} users, dropping to {nonPeakUsers:int} users over {duration:int} minutes is executed
```
Runs a spike test to simulate irregular loads on the system, alternating between a high and low number of users.

| `peakUsers`         |   `int`       | Number of users at each spike                            |
| `nonPeakUsers`      |   `int`       | Number of users off the spikes                           |
| `duration`          |   `int`       | Duration to maintain the load before a spike             |

#### Example:
```gherkin
  When a peak test with 3 spikes of 1000 users, dropping to 200 users over 5 minutes is executed
```

<br /><br />

### Execute Operational Limit Test
```
an operational limit test starting with {users:int} users, increasing by {usersIncrease:int} up to {maxUsers:int} users with ramp-up periods of {duration:int} minutes is executed
```
Runs a test to find the operational limit of the system, progressively increasing the number of users.

#### Parameters:
|  Name               | Wakamiti type | Description                                              |

| `duration`          |   `int`       | Ramp-up time before increasing users                     |

#### Example:
```gherkin
  When an operational limit test starting with 100 users, increasing by 100 up to 5000 users with ramp-up periods of 2 minutes is executed
```

<br /><br />

### Check Response Time Percentile
```
check that the {percentile:int} percentile of response time is less than {duration:int} seconds
check that the {percentile:int} percentile of response time is less than {duration:int} milliseconds
```
Verifies that the specified response time percentile is less than the given duration.

#### Parameters:
| Name          | Wakamiti type | Description                                   |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
