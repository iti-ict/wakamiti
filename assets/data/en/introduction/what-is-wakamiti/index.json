September 2022","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Basic knowledge</strong> <br />\nThis guide assumes that you are familiar with the basics of <a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cucumber</a>,\n<a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gherkin</a> and <a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Behaviour-Driven Development</a>\nmethodology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wakamiti</strong> is a Cucumber-inspired tool written in Java. The main purpose of this application is to do blackbox testing\nusing natural language.</p>\n<p>Just like Cucumber, you can define your tests using natural, human-readable language by adopting the Gherkin <em>grammar</em>,\nfor example. Wakamiti does not bind the steps to its test code. Instead, the steps are bound to a re-usable, common\npurpose code provided by external plugins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Wakamiti can be a convenient tool if your goal is to test your system using standardized protocols such as\nREST web services or JDBC connection, which tend to be a high percentage of the tests written for most applications.\nFurthermore, test code is not required so, even if you are not a programmer, you can define and execute your own tests.</p>\n<p>Other features provided by Wakamiti are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two-layered Gherkin</strong>: you can use Gherkin's grammar at two levels of abstraction. One focused on customer\ncommunication, and other targeted to system details.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully localizable</strong>: use Wakamiti in your own language by providing Wakamiti a translation file.</li>\n<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong>: write your own plugins for any extension point (steps, reporters, language parsers, etc) and\nshare them with the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative launchers</strong>: you can execute Wakamiti as a JUnit test suite, a Maven verify goal, or a console command.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> <br />\nWakamiti is a <em>tool</em>, not a <em>framework</em>. It is not meant to replace Cucumber. In fact, you can use <em>both</em> when needed!</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}},"context":{"id":"9f713bcebcc78c3ff935ed6390cb496f","path":"/en/introduction/what-is-wakamiti/","locale":"en"}}
