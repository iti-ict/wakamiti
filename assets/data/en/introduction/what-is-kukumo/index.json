September 2022","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Basic knowledge</strong> <br />\nThis guide assumes that you know the basics of <a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cucumber</a>,\n<a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gherkin</a> and <a href=\"https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Behaviour-Driven Development</a>\nmethodology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wakamiti</strong> is a Cucumber-inspired tool written in Java focused on blackbox testing using natural language.</p>\n<p>Just like Cucumber, you can define your tests using natural and human-readable language by adopting, for example, the\nGherkin <em>grammar</em>. However, with Wakamiti you do not bind each step to your test code; instead, steps are bound to\nreusable, common-purpose code provided by external plugins.</p>\n<p>Thus, Wakamiti turns out to be a convenient tool if your aim is test your system via standardized protocols such as REST\nweb services or JDBC connection, which tend to be a great deal of percentage of the tests written for most applications.\nAlso, no test code is required to be written, so even non-programmers can define and execute their own tests.</p>\n<p>Other features provided by Wakamiti are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two-layered Gherkin</strong>: you can make use of the Gherkin grammar at two levels of abstraction, one aimed to customer\ncommunication, and other aimed to system details.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully localizable</strong>: you can use your own language as long as you provided Wakamiti with a translation file.</li>\n<li><strong>Easily extensible</strong>: write your own plugins for any extension point (steps, reporters, language parsers, etc) and\nshare them with the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative launchers</strong>: execute Wakamiti as a JUnit test suite, as a Maven verify goal, or directly as a console\ncommand.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong> <br />\nWakamiti is a <em>tool</em>, not a <em>testing framework</em>. Use it when fits the circumstances. Neither is it a replacement for\nCucumber: according your necessities, you might use <em>both</em>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}},"context":{"id":"fc91d7c894db18226592e61dedd28b82","path":"/en/introduction/what-is-kukumo/","locale":"en"}}
