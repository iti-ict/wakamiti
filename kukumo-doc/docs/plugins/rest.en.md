## Configuration

---
###  `rest.baseURL`
Set the base URL for subsequents API calls. This is equivalent to the step "[Define base URL](#define-base-url)" in you 
prefer the descriptive configuration.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  baseURL: https://example.org/api/v2
```

---
### `rest.contentType`
Set the content type that would be sent in the request header of subsequent API calls.
Accepted values are:

| literal    | `content-type` header value                                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ANY`      | `*/*`                                                                  |
| `TEXT`     | `text/plain`                                                           |
| `JSON`     | `application/json, application/javascript, text/javascript, text/json` |
| `XML`      | `application/xml, text/xml, application/xhtml+xml`                     |
| `HTML`     | `text/html`                                                            |
| `URLENC`   | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`                                    |
| `BINARY`   | `application/octet-stream`                                             |


Default value is `JSON`.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  contentType: XML
```

---
### `rest.httpCodeThreshold`
Sets a global HTTP response code threshold. Every time an API call returns an HTTP code equals or greater, the step 
would automatically fail regardless any other condition.

Default value is `500`.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  httpCodeThreshold: 999
```

---
### `rest.oauth2.url`
Set an [OAuth 2.0][oauth2] authentication service that would be used to generate a token in the request header 
`Authorization` of the API calls.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  oauth2: 
    url: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
```


---
### `rest.oauth2.clientId`
Sets the parameter `clientId` of the [OAuth 2.0][oauth2] authentication service defined by the `rest.oauth2.url` value.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  oauth2: 
    clientId: WEB_APP
```

---
### `rest.oauth2.clientSecret`
Sets the parameter `clientSecret` of the [OAuth 2.0][oauth2] authentication service defined by the `rest.oauth2.url` 
value.

Example:

```yaml
rest:
  oauth2: 
    clientSecret: ABRACADABRAus1ZMGHvq9R
```
