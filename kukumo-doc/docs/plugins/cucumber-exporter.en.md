slug: /en/plugins/cucumber-exporter
---

A simple report generator that emits a JSON file with the format used by Cucumber. This is a convenient way of reusing 
some pieces of software designed to work with Cucumber, for example the
[Jenkins Cucumber report plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/cucumber-reports-plugin).

Notice that, although Cucumber and Kukumo share structural similarities in their result format, there are specific 
pieces of information that are not interchangeable. For example, Kukumo works with test plans of unrestricted depth, 
whereas Cucumber expects a fixed three-level structure. Thus, the exported Cucumber JSON file might not be a faithful 
representation of the executed test plan.

## Configuration

---
####  `cucumberExporter.outputFile`
The (relative) path and name of the generated file.

Default value is `cucumber-report.json`.

Example:

```yaml
cucumberExporter:
  outputFile: my-cucumber-report.json
```

---
#### `cucumberExporter.multiLevelStrategy`
Sets the mapping strategy used when the Kukumo plan has more levels than the expected by Cucumber. Accepted values are:
- `innerSteps`: Only the most inner steps would be included, discarding step aggregation levels
- `outerSteps` : Inner steps for any step aggregation would be discarded. The reported step would be the step 
  aggregation itself, although the potential error messages of the inner steps would be reported.

Default value is `innerSteps`.

Example:

```yaml
cucumberExporter:
  multiLevelStrategy: outerSteps
```
