### Added
- New property `childrenResults` in `PlanNodeSnapshot` that collects the result count of direct children.


## [1.1.0] - 2021-09-17

### Added
- New field to `PlanNode` called `executionID`, that is set when the test plan is 
executed. The execution id can be either set via configuration (new property `executionId`) or 
autogenerated otherwise. The same id is shared along every node in the plan and it should be 
unique among different executions. The aim of this new field is provide a way to distinguish
executions when they are run in parallel in a server.
- New method `WakamitiContributors#allContributors()` that returns every contributor

### Modified
- Assertion-like data types now implement their own interface `Assertion` rather than 
using `Matcher` from the *Hamcrest* library. The `MatcherAssertion` class allows mapping to
`Matcher` for convenience.
- Assertion literals `matcher.string.null` and `matcher.number.null` merged into 
`matcher.generic.null` since the translated literals are likely to be the same

### Fixed
- The contributor `ConfigContributor` now extends from `Contributor` (as it should do originally)
