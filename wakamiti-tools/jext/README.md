# jExt

jExt is a simple library that allows you to define a *plug-in* architecture detecting the
Java classes that implements a specific interface. It mostly relies on the standard
[extension mechanism provided](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html)
by Java by means of the [ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
class, but it simplifies and enhances the usage.

The key concepts are:

- **Extension points** (interfaces annotated with `@ExtensionPoint`) which define the contract
- **Extensions** (classes annotated with `@Extension` and implementing the extension point class)
- **Extension managers** that are responsible of retrieve extensions for an specific extension point

What is the extra value then?

- Annotation processing of `@Extension` and `@ExtensionPoint` so the classes are
automatically registered as services by the compiler
- Capability of using multiple class loaders at the same time
- Explicitly declaring the extension point version that implement each extension, avoiding using wrong jar versions
- Custom control about creating new extension instances or reusing existing ones
- Fine extension filtering using white lists and/or black lists
- When extending an extension via inheritance, you may either override the parent class or use both superclass and
subclass independently
