/**
 * A compound resource bundle that combines multiple resource bundles.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@code ResourceBundle} and allows the aggregation of multiple
 * resource bundles. When looking up a resource, it iterates through its internal list
 * of resource bundles to find the first occurrence of the specified key.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are created by providing a list of resource bundles to
 * be aggregated.</p>
 *
 * <p>The implementation overrides the {@link #handleGetObject(String)} method to
 * search for the specified key in the list of resource bundles. It also overrides
 * the {@link #getKeys()} method to collect all keys from the aggregated resource
 * bundles without duplicates.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are typically used to combine resource bundles from
 * different sources, providing a unified interface for resource key lookup.</p>
