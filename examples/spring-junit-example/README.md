Sample Application Features
---------------------------

### REST operations

The API only provides one service with the following CRUD operations on
the entity User:

---

#### Retrieve a list of users
**GET** `http://localhost:9091/users` 
##### returns 200
```json
[
   { 
     "id":  "1" , 
     "firstName": "John", 
     "lastName":  "Doe"
   },
   { 
     "id":  "2" , 
     "firstName": "Sarah", 
     "lastName":  "Connor"
    }
]
```

---

> **NOTE**  
> By default the application port is `9191`, although this can

### Database

The underlying database is formed by a single schema with
the following table:

**USER** 

| column name | data type | primary key | 
| ----------- | --------- | :---------: |
| ID | BIGINT | x |
|FIRST_NAME | VARCHAR | |
| LAST_NAME | VARCHAR | |

The database is created from scratch when the application is launched, 
adding one user.

The client connection URL is `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/mem:test` using the 
username `sa` and an empty password. 

> **NOTE**  
> By default the database port is `9092` and the schema name `test`, 
> although this can be changed editing the `application.yaml` file.  
> Also, you can modify the initial data editing the `initial-data.sql` file.
