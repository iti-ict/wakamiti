This plugin integrates the results of a Wakamiti execution with an existing
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) test plan, being able to attach files (such as the 
one generated by the HTML Reporter plugin) to the Azure run.

In order to notify the results, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- The scenario must be tagged with an specific tag (by default, `@Azure`)
- The scenario msut have defined the properties `azurePlan`, `azureSuite`, and `azureTest`,
valued with the plan name, the suite name, and the test case name that are defined in the Azure
project.

Examples:

```gherkin
@Azure
# azurePlan: MyPlan
# azureSuite: MySuite
# azureTest: MyTest
Feature: User creation tests

Scenario: Create a non-existing user
...

Scenario: Create an existing user
...
```

```gherkin
@Azure
# azurePlan: MyPlan
# azureSuite: MySuite
Feature: User creation tests

# azureTest: MyFirstTest
Scenario: Create a non-existing user
...

# azureTest: MySecondTest
Scenario: Create an existing use
...
```

Test cases not satisfying this criteria will be ignored.

In case the Wakamiti plan includes test cases from several Azure test plans, the plugin will create 
a diferent run for each one of them.
