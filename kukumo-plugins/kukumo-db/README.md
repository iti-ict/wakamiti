# Database Steps

This plugin provides a set of steps that interact with a database via JDBC, easing the effort
required to load and assert data.

Data set can be defined in different ways:

- From CSV files, for a single table
- From XLSX files, for multiple tables
- From data tables included directly in the document, using the format:

```gherkin
 | columnA | columnB | columnC |
 | row1A   | row1B   | row1C   |
 | row2A   | row2B   | row2C   |
```



The plugin source code provides a convenient way to implement new data sources extending the abstract
class `DataSet`, which can be used by third-party contributors.


> **KEEP IN MIND**  
> Regarding the multiple database implementations existing, this plugin **does not** include
any specific driver. In order to work properly, do not forget to include the module with the JDBC driver(s)
that your database connection would require.




## Usage

### Configuration properties

> **KEEP IN MIND**  
> These properties must have the `kukumo.` prefix when defined in an external configuration file.

#### `database.connection.url`
The JDBC database connection URL. The driver used to access the database will be determined by the URL format.

#### `database.connection.username`
The connection username, required to connect.

#### `database.connection.password`
The connection password, required to connect.

#### `database.metadata.schema`
The schema that should be used in order to retrieve meta-data as primary keys and nullability. If not specified, 
the default schema returned by the connection will be used.

#### `database.metadata.catalog`
The catalog that should be used in order to retrieve meta-data as primary keys and nullability. If not specified, the default catalog returned by the connection will be used (in case the database system 
uses one).

#### `database.metadata.caseSensititvy` = [`INSENSITIVE`] | `LOWER_CASED` | `UPPER_CASED`
Configure whether any upper/lower case transformation should be done when trying to access meta-data. 
Some engines are very strict regarding this issue, and can cause unexpected errors if this property is not properly configured.

#### `database.csv.format` = [`DEFAULT`], `INFORMIX_UNLOAD`, `INFORMIX_UNLOAD_CSV`, `MYSQL`, `ORACLE`, `POSTGRESQL_CSV`, `POSTGRESQL_TEXT`, `RFC4180`
The format used to parse CSV files. The accepted values are directly imported from the [Commons CSV][1]
project, check it for detailed explanation of each format.

#### `database.xls.ignoreSheetPattern` = `#.*` 
Regex pattern used to determine what sheets to be ignored when loading XLSX files.

#### `database.nullSymbol` = `<null>`
Literal used to handle a specific cell value as the SQL `NULL` element. It is used in any data source like CSV, XLS, and in-line tables.

#### `database.enableCleanupUponCompletion` = `true | [false]` 
The default behaviour does not perform any clean-up operation following the test plan execution so that
you can check the resulting data afterwards. Switching this parameter to `true` will force
clean-up operations so no test data will remain in the database after the execution of the tests.



### Steps

> **NOTE**   
> The keywords appearing within brackets refer to Gherkin keyword examples, but have no actual meaning

#### Configuration steps

##### *[Given]* the database connection URL ```{url:text}``` using the user ```{username:text}``` and the password ```{password:text}```
Configure the database connection URL, username and password for following connections.  

This step is the declarative equivalent to set the configuration properties `database.connection.url`,
`database.connection.username`, `database.connection.password`.
>```gherkin
> Given the database connection URL 'jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test' using the user 'sa' and the password ''
>```

#### Script execution steps

##### *[Given that/When]* the following SQL script is executed:
Execute a in-line SQL script.

>  DELETE FROM USER WHERE STATE = 3;
> """
>```

##### *[Given that/When]* the SQL script file {file} is executed
Execute a SQL script file.
>```gherkin
